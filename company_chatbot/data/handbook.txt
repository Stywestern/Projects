## Company Philosophy
TechCorp believes in "radical transparency" and "sustainable pace." We do not believe in crunch time. If you are working past 6 PM, you are doing it wrong.

## Remote Work Policy
Employees are allowed to work remotely 3 days a week. Tuesdays and Thursdays are "Core Days" where everyone is expected to be in the office (or on the company Discord) between 10 AM and 2 PM.

## Vacation & Leave
- **Standard Leave:** All employees start with 20 days of paid time off (PTO).
- **Tenure Bonus:** For every year you stay, you gain 1 extra day, capped at 30 days total.
- **Sick Leave:** You have unlimited sick leave, but if you take more than 3 consecutive days, a doctor's note is required.

## Expense Policy
- **Meals:** Travel meals are capped at $50 per day.
- **Equipment:** Every new hire gets a $2,000 budget for a laptop and a $500 budget for home office setup (chair, monitor, etc.).
- **Approval:** Expenses under $50 do not require manager approval.

## IT Support
If you are locked out of your account, do NOT email the CEO. Create a ticket at support.techcorp.com. Password resets typically take 4 hours.
